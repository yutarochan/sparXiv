A repository for summarized machine learning papers (aka *The Sparknotes for Papers*). Inspired by [arXivTimes](https://github.com/arXivTimes/arXivTimes), a Japanese version of quick summary of papers. This can be considered as the English translateed mirror of arXivTimes.

**UPATE**: I am currently trying my best to port all of the contents from the original paper. If you know Japanese and would like to help port the contents over, please let me know.
